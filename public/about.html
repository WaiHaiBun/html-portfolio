<p>
  I graduated from the University of Auckland with a Bachelor of Science, majoring in Food Science and Technology. </p>
  My first job in the industry was at a contract manufacturing place as a quality assurance officer. 
  My main responsibilities included ensuring the quality of our products and ensuring we complied with industry standards. 
  To be honest, I didn't enjoy working there due to the environment and general vibe of the place. 
  There were often times when I had to do the work of 2 people and there was no reward for it.
</p>

<p>
  At the end of 2023, I decided to find a different job as I had reached my emtional limit.
  I am currently working as a Enterprise Sales Representative at a Office Solutions company. 
  On the technical side, this job is a lot simpler. However, there is the added challenge of communicating with different stakeholders. 
  I am quite a timid person, so I sometimes find it hard to tell someone that they are wrong or putting my opinion out there. 
  That is something I am working on this year. 
</p>

<p>
  Even though I am enjoying the new work environment a lot more, I wish I could work remotely at a further extent as I miss my other home; Taiwan. 
  That is why I am currently doing The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp. 
  My goal is to complete this course by the end of August 2024 and start looking for industry experience
</p>

<p> 
  I recently got engaged - my fiancee proposed to me at Mt. Fuji in Japan! 
  We are planning only getting married by November 2024 so there is a lot on our plate this year.
</p>

<P>
  Thank you so much for reading this if you have gotten this far!
